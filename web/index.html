		<h1>BINLang</h1>
		<p>This is an online website that allows you to compile the program code into binary files for faster execution, compared to traditional interpreters.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions, here is the list of questions that are frequently asked (FAQ):</p>
		<h2>Why use BINLang?</h2>
		<p>BINLang takes up a lot less storage compared to traditional program files, mainly because of it's binary architecture, and how it's programs are compressed. It also has a faster speed execution, since interpreters for the program file don't have to lex, or parse the file; they could instead interpret the file directly, reducing overhead of the program.</p>
		<h2>Do I have to use BINLang?</h2>
		<p>No, you don't have to use BINLang if this programming language is not required for your projects.</p>
		<h2>Which programming language does BINLang run on?</h2>
		<p>BINLang generally runs on JavaScript for the compilation, and a <a href="//lua.org">Lua</a> version of the compiler may be available in the near future.</p>
		<h2>Can I switch to BINLang right now?</h2>
		<p>You most certainly can switch to BINLang right now! But again, you don't have to if you don't want to.</p>
		<h2>Why was BINLang introduced?</h2>
		<p>BINLang was introduced to help reduce the amount of storage space needed. Having 800 bytes for a program that just logs six messages - takes up an unnecessary amount of space. So that's why BINLang is introduced into the internet.</p>
		<h2>How is a BINLang program compressed?</h2>
		<p>The BINLang compiler typically compresses the program by just minimizing the identifiers by packing each four letters into a single byte each, and putting a "uniqueness" flag at the end of the compressed identifiers, to make sure the variables don't get confused with each other.</p>
		<h2>When was BINLang introduced?</h2>
		<p>BINLang was introduced at the following date: 10/5/2024.</p>
		<h2>Where can I learn BINLang?</h2>
		<p>You can learn BINLang <a href="/binlang-compiler/web/tutorial.html">here</a>!</p>
