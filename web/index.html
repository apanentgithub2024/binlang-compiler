		<h1>BINLang</h1>
		<p>This is an online website that allows you to compile the program code into binary files for faster execution, compared to traditional interpreters.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions, here is the list of questions that are frequently asked (FAQ):</p>
		<h2>Why use BINLang?</h2>
		<p>BINLang takes up a lot less storage compared to traditional program files, mainly because of it's binary architecture, and how it's programs are compressed. It also has a faster speed execution, since interpreters for the program file don't have to lex, or parse the file; they could instead interpret the file directly, reducing overhead of the program.</p>
		<h2>Do I have to use BINLang?</h2>
		<p>No, you don't have to use BINLang if this programming language is not required for your projects.</p>
		<h2>Which programming language does BINLang run on?</h2>
		<p>BINLang generally runs on JavaScript for the compilation, and a <a href="//lua.org">Lua</a> version of the compiler may be available in the near future.</p>
		<h2>Can I switch to BINLang right now?</h2>
		<p>You most certainly can switch to BINLang right now! But again, you don't have to if you don't want to.</p>
		<h2>Why was BINLang introduced?</h2>
		<p>BINLang was introduced to help reduce the amount of storage space needed. Having 1400 bytes for a program that just logs six messages - takes up an unnecessary amount of space, and is harder to send through the internet than compact programs, because they're smaller (in size). So that's why BINLang is introduced into the internet.</p>
		<h2>How is a BINLang program compressed?</h2>
		<p>The BINLang compiler typically compresses the program by just minimizing the identifiers by packing each four letters into a single byte each, and putting a "uniqueness" flag at the end of the compressed identifiers, to make sure the variables don't get confused with each other.</p>
		<h2>When was BINLang introduced?</h2>
		<p>BINLang was introduced at the following date: 10/5/2024.</p>
		<h2>Where can I learn BINLang?</h2>
		<p>You can learn BINLang <a href="/binlang-compiler/web/tutorial.html">here</a>!</p>
		<h2>Is BINLang certified, and verified for security?</h2>
		<p>It is not verified and certified to be safe by communities, though this programming language is still safe to use, and secure when in use.</p>
